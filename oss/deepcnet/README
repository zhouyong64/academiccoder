Ben Graham - 9 November 2013
Supporting code for: Sparse arrays of signatures for online character recognition
Implementation of DeepCNets convolutional neural networks.

Instructions for use:
Check you have the Nvidia CUDA SDK installed.
Put data files in the Data/ directory.
Then run "make x" where x is one of {mnist, ujipenchars, assamese, casiaOnline, casiaOffline, pendigits, cifar10}.

The network parameters are specified in the .cu files, one per dataset.

Aside:
In the paper, most of the results are using RECTIFIEDLINEAR units in the first n-2 layers, TANH units in the (n-1)th layer and SOFTMAX in the final layer.
For CNNs with dropout, RECTIFIEDLINEAR units were used for all of the first n-1 layers---this is how the DeepCNet object created in the file CNN.h is set to behave.
